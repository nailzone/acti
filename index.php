<p>This diagram shows the  methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements. In this context, the term "system" refers to something being developed or operated. Actor in a use case diagram is any entity that performs a role in one given system. This could be a person, organization or an external system. A use case represents a function or an action within the system. It’s drawn as an oval and named with the function. The system is used to define the scope of the use case and drawn as a rectangle. This an optional element but useful when you’re visualizing large systems. For example, you can create all the use cases and then use the system object to define the scope covered by your project. Or you can even use it to show the different areas covered in different releases. In my diagram I created there are three actors, the client ,admin and the employee. They have their own specific task to do and you can see that by just looking in the diagram. Every one  of the actors has a relationship with each other. The client provide a project for the employee and the employee do the project for the client while the admin is the one who manage all type of user in the  system.</p>
